# yoga_pose_correction

Yoga pose correction is a fascinating application of computer vision and machine learning techniques aimed at helping practitioners achieve correct postures. Leveraging technologies like OpenCV and MediaPipe, developers can create systems that analyze body movements and provide real-time feedback for improving yoga poses. This project involves capturing video input, detecting body landmarks, analyzing the pose, and giving corrective feedback.

Technologies Used: OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library, used for image and video processing.

MediaPipe: A framework for building multimodal (e.g., video, audio, etc.) applied machine learning pipelines, which provides pre-trained models for pose estimation.

Workflow: video Capturing: The system starts by capturing video from a webcam or a video file. OpenCV is typically used for this purpose.

Pose Detection with MediaPipe: MediaPipe provides a pose detection solution that can identify and track body landmarks (such as shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, etc.) in real-time.

Processing Frames: Each frame from the video capture is processed to detect and extract body landmarks.

Landmark Extraction: Extract the key landmarks detected by MediaPipe.

Pose Analysis: Analyze the extracted landmarks to determine the correctness of the pose. This involves calculating angles between various joints and comparing them with the standard angles for the desired pose.

Feedback Generation: Provide corrective feedback based on the pose analysis. This can be done by highlighting incorrect angles and suggesting adjustments.

Visualization: Display the processed video with landmarks and feedback overlay.

Cleanup: Release resources.
